## Creation of a Web Application using the following technologies:
#	- Spring MVC
#	- Spring Boot
#	- Spring Data JPA
#	- Thymeleaf
#	- H2 database
#	- Maven

## Why these technologies?

# Spring 4 MVC has several features to make the development more fast and to have easy maintenance, e.g.: Dependency injection, easy handling of routes to
#create in your controller, easy handling between controller and the part of the view (use of Thymeleaf) among others.
# Still, Spring has a backend structural where uses WebSocket to connect the server and the client, where make it easy to send data from Controller to Frontend.
# The use of Spring Boot explain for the fact that it comes pre-configured, have a set of frameworks/technologies to reduce the time of configuration
#provinding you the shortest way to have a Spring Web application. In the Spring Boot page we can have a simples RESTful application up and running
#with almost zero configuration (https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/).
# Spring Boot comes with Spring Data JPA, as well as the Thymeleaf and H2 database. Spring Data JPA uses the JPA API to have an integration with H2 database,
#beeing easy to create your repositories. Thymeleaf comes with Spring Boot and this is often used in HTML pages, by tags. I used this because Spring Boot creates
#a bridge between server and client and then, is easy to handler the data and put into the HTML page.
# Maven is a tool that helps the developer to make build of your project, to choose several external libraries and put them into your application just with 
#little configuration. Maven is one of the most used in the world to build projects.

## What I expect?
#
# Would like to work in an amazing team where I would have the chance to exchange technical information and everyday looking for personal growth. Always
#looking for be happy to work consciously to be prepared for new big challenges. This is what let me happy.

# Thank you.
